## Phaser3 v3.6.0 Boiler Plate

#### Phaser3 + ES6 + Webpack

This repository was created to provide a basic setup, easy to setup environment for creating Phaser3 games. This set is based on the Generic Platformer and Bootstrap Phaser Project by Niklas Berg (https://github.com/nkholski/phaser3-es6-webpack).

## Setup
You'll need to install a few things before you have a working project including coping this repo to a new project directory.

### 1. Install node.js and npm:
https://nodejs.org/en/

### 2. Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project folder.

Run:
`npm install` or `yarn`

### 3. Run Development Server

Run:
`npm run dev`

This will run a server so that your game will nun in the browser in a browser. This will also start a watch process, that will recompile and refresh the browser when a change is saved to a source file.

Open your browser and enter `localhost:3000`

## Development Build

Run: `npm run deploy`

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
